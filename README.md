# Nextcloud Applicationset - ARGOCD, Helm

[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is a file sharing server that puts the control and security of your own data back into your hands.

I provide a manifest for argocd which is integrated with gitlab generator. 
Purpose of this project was to design an automated way to deploy nextcloud app per user in different namespaces.
